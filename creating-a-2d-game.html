        <h1>Creating Your First 2D Game in Unity</h1>
        <article>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This tutorial will guide you through creating a basic 2D platformer game in Unity. You'll learn about Unity's interface, basic scripting, and game mechanics.</p>
        
            <h3>Step 1: Setting Up Your Project</h3>
            <p>Create a new project in Unity Hub, select the 2D template, and name your project 'First2DGame'.</p>
        
            <h3>Step 2: Designing the Game Scene</h3>
            <p>The game scene is where you'll design your game world. Add a sprite for the ground and a player character.</p>
        
            <h3>Step 3: Scripting Player Movement</h3>
            <p>We'll write a simple script to control the player. Attach a new script named 'PlayerController' to your player sprite.</p>
        
            <pre><code>// PlayerController.cs
            using UnityEngine;
        
            public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour {
                public float moveSpeed = 5f; // Speed of the player
                public Rigidbody2D rb; // Reference to the Rigidbody2D component
                private Vector2 moveDirection; // The direction of movement
        
                void Update() {
                    ProcessInputs(); // Handle user inputs
                }
        
                void FixedUpdate() {
                    Move(); // Apply movement
                }
        
                void ProcessInputs() {
                    float moveX = Input.GetAxisRaw("Horizontal"); // Get horizontal input
                    moveDirection = new Vector2(moveX, 0).normalized; // Set the move direction
                }
        
                void Move() {
                    rb.velocity = new Vector2(moveDirection.x * moveSpeed, rb.velocity.y); // Move the player
                }
            }</code></pre>
            <p>This script enables the player to move left or right using the arrow keys. 'Input.GetAxisRaw("Horizontal")' gets the player's horizontal input, and 'rb.velocity' applies movement to the player.</p>
        
            <h3>Step 4: Adding Jump Mechanics</h3>
            <p>Let's enhance the player's movement with a jump ability.</p>
            <pre><code>public float jumpForce = 15f; // Jump force
            public bool isGrounded = false; // Is the player on the ground?
        
            void Update() {
                if (Input.GetButtonDown("Jump") && isGrounded) {
                    rb.AddForce(new Vector2(0f, jumpForce), ForceMode2D.Impulse); // Add an upward force
                }
            }</code></pre>
            <p>This code allows the player to jump by pressing the space bar. It checks if the player is on the ground ('isGrounded') to prevent mid-air jumps.</p>
            
            <h3>Step 5: Adding Obstacles</h3>
<p>Obstacles add challenges to your game. Let's add a simple obstacle.</p>
<ul>
    <li>In the Unity Editor, add another sprite to act as an obstacle.</li>
    <li>Position it in your scene where it can challenge the player.</li>
    <li>Add a Collider component to it (like a BoxCollider2D) so it can interact with the player.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the player collides with the obstacle, you can trigger a game over or reduce the player's health.</p>
<h3>Step 6: Creating Collectibles</h3>
<p>Collectibles can be coins, stars, or any item that the player can collect.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Add a new sprite to your scene to represent the collectible.</li>
    <li>Give it a Collider component, set to 'Is Trigger' so the player can pass through it.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D other) {
    if (other.gameObject.CompareTag("Player")) {
        // Add score or perform an action
        Destroy(gameObject); // Destroy the collectible
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>This script will destroy the collectible when the player touches it, potentially increasing the player's score.</p>
<h3>Step 7: Implementing Game Mechanics</h3>
<p>Add basic game mechanics like scoring and a game over condition.</p>
<pre><code>public int score = 0;

void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D other) {
    if (other.gameObject.CompareTag("Collectible")) {
        score++;
        Destroy(other.gameObject);
    } else if (other.gameObject.CompareTag("Obstacle")) {
        // Game over logic
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>This script increases the score when collecting items and triggers a game over when hitting obstacles.</p>

<h3>Step 8: Building and Running Your Game</h3>
<p>Once you're happy with your game, it's time to build and test it.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Go to 'File' > 'Build Settings' in Unity.</li>
    <li>Select your target platform (e.g., Windows, Mac, Android).</li>
    <li>Click 'Build and Run' to build your game and run it on your chosen platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>After building, you'll have an executable version of your game to share or test further.</p>

            <!-- Additional steps for obstacles, collectibles, game mechanics, building the game, etc. -->
        
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>By following these steps, you've created a simple 2D platformer game. Experiment with adding more features and mechanics to enhance your game.</p>
