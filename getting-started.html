        <h1>Getting Started with Unity</h1>
        <article>
            <h2>Introduction to Unity</h2>
            <p>Unity is a versatile game engine that enables developers to create interactive content such as video games, simulations, and virtual reality experiences. In this tutorial, we will walk through the basic steps to get started with Unity, including installation, setting up a project, and exploring the Unity interface.</p>

            <h3>Step 1: Downloading and Installing Unity</h3>
            <p>To begin, you need to download and install the Unity Hub. Unity Hub is a software that manages Unity installations and projects.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Visit the <a href="https://unity.com/download" target="_blank">Unity Download Page</a> and download Unity Hub.</li>
                <li>Install Unity Hub on your computer.</li>
                <li>Open Unity Hub, and navigate to the 'Installs' tab. Click on the 'Add' button to add a new Unity version.</li>
                <li>Select the latest stable version of Unity for installation. You may also include additional modules based on your development needs (such as support for Android or iOS platforms).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 2: Creating Your First Unity Project</h3>
            <p>Once Unity is installed, you can create your first project.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Open Unity Hub and go to the 'Projects' tab.</li>
                <li>Click on the 'New Project' button. Choose a template that suits the type of project you want to create. For beginners, the '3D' template is a good starting point.</li>
                <li>Enter a project name and select a location on your computer to save the project.</li>
                <li>Click on 'Create' to create your new Unity project.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 3: Exploring the Unity Interface</h3>
            <p>The Unity interface consists of several panels and windows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scene View:</strong> This is where you can visually manipulate and organize objects in your game.</li>
                <li><strong>Game View:</strong> Here you can preview your game as it will appear to the players.</li>
                <li><strong>Hierarchy:</strong> Displays all the objects in the current scene, arranged in a tree structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Inspector:</strong> Shows detailed information and settings for the selected game object.</li>
                <li><strong>Project:</strong> Manages all assets associated with your project.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 4: Building a Simple Scene</h3>
            <p>Let's build a simple scene with basic shapes.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In the Hierarchy window, right-click and select '3D Object' > 'Cube' to add a cube to the scene.</li>
                <li>Use the toolbar at the top of the Scene View to move, rotate, and scale the cube.</li>
                <li>Add more objects like a Sphere or Plane to create a basic environment.</li>
                <li>Click on the 'Play' button at the top of the screen to enter the Game View and interact with your scene.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p>Congratulations on setting up your first Unity scene! From here, you can explore more advanced topics like materials, lighting, and scripting to bring your projects to life.</p>
